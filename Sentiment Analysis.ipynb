If you've been told nothing, than you are very lucky; the first time I saw I knew nothing either, and it was a revelation - I came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes - cinema can do THAT?!  I absorbed every Melville film I could find (they are VERY hard to get), and read every article or book about him.  My love grew to uncontrollable passion.  But a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work, and this sublime miracle especially.The most obvious is the director's obsession with American cinema.  That his films are mere tributes to American cinema, or stern deconstructions of them.  It is true that Jef Costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby, but so do at least 400 men in Paris.  And it is true that Melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster, but, most importantly, of masculinity and its power.  Elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here, the idea that Jef begins the film 'whole', looking at the mirror; during the course of the narrative he loses this self-sufficient image, cracking up as it fragments, split by mirrors, trapped behind bars (although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this).Others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies.  Some see Jef as an example of existentialist man, a man who does not exist except through his acts - the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking, staring, preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death; as existentialism suggests, friends, social purpose etc. fall away, and one is left alone with one's fate.  Or as an expression of fatalistic Orientalist ethics (the film IS called 'Le Samourai') concerning solitude and the inevitability of death.  Melville himself offered two possible interpretations - as a study in schizophrenia, and as an allegory of Man (Jef) pursued by Destiny (the Inspector) into the arms of Death (Valerie, the pianist).All of these, of course, are valid interpretations.  I am more sympathetic to those who see 'Samourai' as a dream, a study in solitude, or a portrait of mental breakdown.  The film's action takes place largely at night; there is a frequently oneiric tone to Melville's style, the endless walking, the silence, the deliberate  paring down of the mise-en-scene to near-monochrome.  Jef's impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist, walking mechanically down countless corridors.  As in a dream, whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way.  We keep returning to the same few locales.  The film opens with Jef lying smoking in bed, in the dark; one powerful scene is Jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm - has he had a nightmare, or is it the sound of a passing truck?'Samourai' is also much more moving as a story of solitude than Antonioni's entire oeuvre put together.  The only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is Jef's loneliness, living with his only friend, a caged bullfinch (usually a symbol of female entrapment) in a dismally run-down, sparse grey bedsit, prey to any intruders.  Although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police, he is safer on the margins, in anonymous streets, abandoned railway yards, disused buildings. Or at least he was before all the trouble started.  He is defined against the grim, geometric anonymity of modern life, his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in, the elevator shafts that imprison him.  He is the image of man in a surveillance society, an innocent man (until proven guilty) having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat (many people see Melville's films as sublimated allegories of France under the Occupation). \n",
       "His only contact with people is in the preparation of death; his is a sterile, self-negating existence, ascetic as a monk (his uniform as ritual vestments).  That Jef is a tragically lonely man is undoubted.  There are two heartbreaking moments in this cool, austere film, when emotion breaks Alain Delon's astonishing performance, the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in 'La Jetee': when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist; his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught, helpless, a child looking for a mother to reassure him (this is the key to the film, I believe, Jef the lonely wanderer searching for home); the second, after the celebrated Metro chase, in the stolen car, his face, for a moment, betraying hear-beating terror. At these moments, allegories and theories simply break down.Jef's mental breakdown is, of course, linked to all this.  Over the credits, Jef smokes alone in his bedroom, barely visible - the two bright windows look like eyes, as in Beckett's 'End Game', a figure for the mind, a mind at the end of its tether as seen by Melville's horizontal use of Hitchcock's famous 'Vertigo' shot, contracting and constricting the room to breaking point, revealing the instability of this 'safe' haven, and Jef's image of himself.  Mental deterioration is usually a subject of horror movies - the score features frequent bursts of chilling organ; when Jef goes to collect his car and gun for the contract, his accomplice, lit by a lamp, looks like a terrifying spirit.  Jef is a trapped character, in his room, identity, plot; by the police and the gangsters; by geography, shadows, corridors; by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point - he is in hell; the only way out is self extinction.It is important not to see Melville as  child of Sartre, which limits him, but of Nabokov, whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work - it is vitally important not to take him at face value.  Jef's shooting of Rey - impossible, magical - is pure Nabokov.  I could go on - the Benjaminian idea of the flaneur and Paris; the extraordinary, near-futuristic sets; the comedy (e.g. see who Jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description); its remarkable analysis of the gaze; the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics; the running motif of the theatre, performing, acting (in both senses) - Jef's costume; the line-up in a theatre-like space; the closing 'show is over' drum-roll.  Everything about this film, as John Woo noted, is perfect, but there is one sequence, breaking with Melville's calm, distant style throughout, that I would list on my ten best ever - as Jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun - firstly he faces the audience; we could be no closer.  Then, just as the struggle begins, Melville cuts away, his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills, following Jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailant's car.  It is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known.  I've just watched it twice in two days; I really must watch it again.</td><td>rw0099143</td><td>Along with 'The Wizard of Oz', the supreme film about the longing for home.</td><td>the red duchess</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 12)</td><td>Le Samouraï (1967)</td><td>7</td><td>20 September 2001</td><td>A rare film where Alain Delon played together with his wife, Nathalie.

I liked it enough the first time I saw it many years ago that when I saw it recently on the shelf in my local video store, I wanted to see it again. The film has a lot of style, good use of sound and music and the presence of Alain Delon. After seeing this film for a second time recently, just as another commentator in the forum noticed, I was impressed how this film must have been very influential on American film makers in the seventies. Many thrillers of the seventies feature a loner hero much like Jef Costello.\n",
       "However, is this a great film? I don't think so. Roger Ebert and many high brow critics (you know, the ones who like to use words like \"Kafkaesque\", \"existential\" and \"archetypal\") consider this to be one of  the most perfect films ever made. But the film is far from perfect. The film at times slows down a lot. There is (mentioned previously by another commentator in this forum) the overly long and pointless scene where the cops bug Costello's apartment. Then there is an overly long scene of Costello tending to a gun shot wound. It always annoys me when I see critics (American ones) heap praises on European made films and then totally ignore or dismiss similar American films that are just as good or better than their European counterparts. Perhaps its just Paris envy.</td><td>rw0099146</td><td>Paris envy?</td><td>youroldpaljim</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(13, 32)</td><td>Le Samouraï (1967)</td><td>5</td><td>11 January 2003</td><td>The movie's title and opening epigraph refer to samurai, but tone and content owe more to existentialist posturing and the anti-heroes of stylized detective fiction.The title character of \"Le samourai\" is Jef Costello, a brooding loner and chick magnet, by profession a hired killer.  The movie begins with him setting about a new job with a seemingly unperturbable quiet competence, and an array of neat tricks to make himself unlinkable to the crime.  SLIGHT SPOILER: The putz then commits the murder undisguised, in earshot and almost in sight of a club full of people. Through sheer dumb luck, most witnesses are unreliable, and a pianist who can identify Costello feigns ignorance because she has fallen for him.  Costello is oblivious enough to his own bungling for his coolness to remain intact.  Ditto the movie.  There is more plot, but it's mood that matters, so who cares.Japan eliminated stipends of and formally abolished the samurai after they proved impotent against Perry's black ships and other small Western forces, and replaced them with what was to become a competent modern army.  Although samurai may still enjoy a hokey stylishness, movies, even thrillers, that wish to be serious rather than silly might be well advised to follow that example.</td><td>rw0099147</td><td>Stylish and cluelessly silly.

He is hired to kill the owner of a club and becomes the prime suspect of the murder. However, his perfect alibi drops the accusation against him. His girlfriend Jane (Nathalie Delon), her client and citizen above any suspicion Wiener (Michel Boisrond) and Valerie (Cathy Rosier), the pianist of the club and main witness of the crime, provide the necessary evidence of his innocence supporting his alibi. Free, he is betrayed and chased by the gangsters sent by the one that hired him and also by the police, not convinced of his innocence. Jef seeks out who has hired him to revenge.\"Le Samourai\" is a great French film noir with a surprising end. The plot is developed in slow pace, but with an outstanding performance of Alain Delon in the role of a cold blood killer of few words. This movie presents one of the most perfect alibis that I have seen in the cinema.My interpretation for the conclusion is the following: \"Le Samourai\" begins with a reference to the \"Bushido Code\", which is the Samurai Code, and the title is \"The Samurai\".Jef Costello, performed by Alain Delon, is the samurai, who kills his master after his betrayal, and has been discovered by the police. Therefore, he is a modern samurai in disgrace.In accordance with the Bushido Code, he must commit Harakiri, or Seppuku. Then he says farewell to Jane and goes to the night-club without any alibi (his \"modus-operandi\") or disguise, and he pretends that he will accomplish with his contract killing the piano player, to die with honor. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Samurai\" (\"The Samurai\")Note: On 02 June 2013, I saw this movie again.</td><td>rw0099149</td><td>One of the Most Perfect Alibis in a Great French Film Noir</td><td>claudio_carvalho</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(63, 92)</td><td>Le Samouraï (1967)</td><td>10</td><td>1 August 2004</td><td>Jean-Pierre Melville took the idea of the lone gunman (perhaps more akin to the western genre than the crime genre), and created a film with star Alain Delon as a ultra-calm, smooth-operating contract killer Jeff Costello in Paris, who may be at least a little insane. The result is a blend of stylistic and thematic excellence, a suspense film where sometimes that aspect has to take a backseat to the psychological drama of the killer, and the side-story of the police procedural (headed by 'Superintendant' played by Francois Perier). The film carries very little dialog with a couple of exceptions, which gives Melville a chance to perfect his storytelling technique. Deleon, as well, was a very fit choice for the role of Costello. It's actually fascinating that Melville made this character, mostly a night owl with a look that's usually cold and hard boiled like some neo-hood from the 30's, the protagonist. There's also the look of the film, provided in part by Henri Decae, who would later lens Melville's epic Le Cercle Rouge. In the opening shot, were given the feeling of distortion on Costello's uniquely blank one-room apartment. Is this to bring us inside of Costello's frayed consciousness, or is it just one of those style moves done by directors in the 60's? I might go for the psychological part, but what I noticed about Le Samourai, adding to the appeal of it, was the theme of Costello's mind-set is put forth subtlety. This is a pro put into tight circumstances (getting heat from his employers as well as the police), so who is there for him to go to? Just an on & off again girlfriend (Nathalie Delon), a little bird in his apartment, and a witness to one of his contracts (the late Cathy Rosier, in a performance of some note despite the one-sidedness of her part). When the action comes, it's not as bloody as in the films it later inspired (most obvious of which are John Woo's The Killer and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog), yet that too just adds on to the emotions provoked by the settings and the mis-en-scene.So, would I recommend Le Samourai to fans of crime films? Well, it may not to those who sole obsession are the crime films that pack all the high octane juice and gore, such as in a John Woo or Hong-Kong action film, or to the Tarantino fans that may not appreciate the patience Melville has (the deliberate pace and silences) as opposed to laughs and ultra-violence. I'd guess that Le Samourai is most successful, and why it is one of the best films I will ever see, because it is heavy on the nuance and detail, doesn't skimp on keeping the genre characters believable, and leaves the gun-play as true surprises even on repeat viewings (however, this is the kind of film to be watched maybe once every year or once ever few years, so that it keeps fresh when seen again). Aside from delivering the goods in terms of the story and as a drama, for the audience it seeks out it's highly absorbing and an example of subtlety in cinematic grammar. It's not a crime or police movie for the mainstream (and I'm sure some will seek this out from the under-ground buzz, start watching and say, \"oh man, this stuff's in subtitles? I can't bear to watch\"). Really, it's appeal will hold more to fans of the french new-wave, which Melville set off with Bob le Flambeur, film-geeks, and for those looking for a dosage of atmosphere and cool bravura directors can't seem to latch onto in recent times. For me, it is one of the truly sublime time-capsule of what the gangster/noir genre/mood can produce.</td><td>rw0099150</td><td>May be my favorite Melville film with a style that has inspired some, but is hard to match</td><td>Quinoa1984</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(6, 7)</td><td>Sangre de vírgenes (1967)</td><td>4</td><td>11 July 2002</td><td>The worst aspect of this film is most definitely the tired script. For starters, the basic plot involves a group of young people running out of petrol and having to spend the night in a creepy house (not very original). It then turns out that the house is populated by vampires (not that you wouldn't have guessed that from the title of the film). It doesn't get any better after that either.But the film does have a certain charm. The obligatory (for a 1967 horror film that is) sex and drugs scene at the beginning of the film is good fun (love that music!). The lead female vampire is very attractive and as such is destined to be seen naked at some point in the film. The surreal use of a seagull filmed through a red filter as a cheap alternative to a bat also adds to the charm of the film.Overall, it's a recommended film if you're a fan of vampire films and haven't yet seen the genre done Argentinian-style.</td><td>rw0099151</td><td>A bite out of Argentina</td><td>Maringo</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(2, 10)</td><td>Sangre de vírgenes (1967)</td><td>2</td><td>3 June 2004</td><td>ZzzzzzzzzzzHow many ways can you write off yet another foreign vampire film whose main concern seems to be how many girls in gowns, fangs and breasts it can offer during its running time?

The only things saving this from being rated a total BOMB - aside from the aforementioned babes, that is - would be an artsy credits sequence at the beginning and a couple of well executed kill sequences to open one eyelid for in between naps. * out of ****</td><td>rw0099152</td><td>Blood of the Virgins (1967) *</td><td>JoeKarlosi</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>List(4, 7)</td><td>Catch As Catch Can (1967)</td><td>null</td><td>1 February 2000</td><td>In the early 70's, when I was in my early teens, television was an experimental place, especially on Sundays.  All sorts of interesting shows came over the color television in my family's living room, and the black-and-white one in my bed- room.  WTVC's \"Sunday Cinema\" showed some of the highest mo- ments at the apex of TV weirdness: Sunday afternoon.  One day I tuned in, and a film called \"Catch As Catch Can\" was on. It was an Italian film, dubbed in English.  My grandmother and I were in the living room watching, and I noticed it was some- thing I'd never seen before: a sex comedy!  No nudity, mind you (except for a centerfold one of the characters was ogling), but plenty of scantily-clad, well-endowed maidens.  And plenty of opportunities taken by the director to make sure the women were photographed from some point above their heads, putting their ample cleavage on display.  Up to this point, I'd only seen the likes in Life magazine spreads on Raquel Welch, and the Mark Eden Bust Enhancer ads in Redbook.  Grandmother was under- standably concerned about the quality of viewing, so she changed the channel to something else after we viewed a swim- ming pool scene in which a woman almost drowns and is resus- citated by the hero, poised above her ample bosom.  I went to my room, presumably to read.  I turned the movie back on in there.  There were other scenes I've forgotten, but one bit of titillation sticks in my mind: the hero and some busty woman rolling round and round in a giant soup can that's floating down some river.  I had a breast fixation for years after seeing the film.  I was in absolute heaven.  Story? Why worry about that?  I am decidedly more sexually mature--and definitely more politically correct--now that I am 42, but I am still very glad WTVC, for whatever reason, put that film on that day.</td><td>rw0099153</td><td>Remembering This Film From WTVC's \"Sunday Cinema\"</td><td>bimp-3</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

Jef is a trapped character, in his room, identity, plot; by the police and the gangsters; by geography, shadows, corridors; by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point - he is in hell; the only way out is self extinction.It is important not to see Melville as  child of Sartre, which limits him, but of Nabokov, whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work - it is vitally important not to take him at face value.  Jef's shooting of Rey - impossible, magical - is pure Nabokov.  I could go on - the Benjaminian idea of the flaneur and Paris; the extraordinary, near-futuristic sets; the comedy (e.g. see who Jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description); its remarkable analysis of the gaze; the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics; the running motif of the theatre, performing, acting (in both senses) - Jef's costume; the line-up in a theatre-like space; the closing 'show is over' drum-roll.  Everything about this film, as John Woo noted, is perfect, but there is one sequence, breaking with Melville's calm, distant style throughout, that I would list on my ten best ever - as Jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun - firstly he faces the audience; we could be no closer.  Then, just as the struggle begins, Melville cuts away, his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills, following Jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailant's car.  It is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known.  I've just watched it twice in two days; I really must watch it again.",

         "First let me say that I think LE SAMOURAI is a good film. I liked it enough the first time I saw it many years ago that when I saw it recently on the shelf in my local video store, I wanted to see it again. The film has a lot of style, good use of sound and music and the presence of Alain Delon. After seeing this film for a second time recently, just as another commentator in the forum noticed, I was impressed how this film must have been very influential on American film makers in the seventies. Many thrillers of the seventies feature a loner hero much like Jef Costello.\nHowever, is this a great film? I don't think so. Roger Ebert and many high brow critics (you know, the ones who like to use words like \"Kafkaesque\", \"existential\" and \"archetypal\") consider this to be one of  the most perfect films ever made. But the film is far from perfect. The film at times slows down a lot. There is (mentioned previously by another commentator in this forum) the overly long and pointless scene where the cops bug Costello's apartment. Then there is an overly long scene of Costello tending to a gun shot wound. It always annoys me when I see critics (American ones) heap praises on European made films and then totally ignore or dismiss similar American films that are just as good or better than their European counterparts. Perhaps its just Paris envy.",

The movie begins with him setting about a new job with a seemingly unperturbable quiet competence, and an array of neat tricks to make himself unlinkable to the crime.  SLIGHT SPOILER: The putz then commits the murder undisguised, in earshot and almost in sight of a club full of people. Through sheer dumb luck, most witnesses are unreliable, and a pianist who can identify Costello feigns ignorance because she has fallen for him.  Costello is oblivious enough to his own bungling for his coolness to remain intact.  Ditto the movie.  There is more plot, but it's mood that matters, so who cares.Japan eliminated stipends of and formally abolished the samurai after they proved impotent against Perry's black ships and other small Western forces, and replaced them with what was to become a competent modern army.

However, his perfect alibi drops the accusation against him. His girlfriend Jane (Nathalie Delon), her client and citizen above any suspicion Wiener (Michel Boisrond) and Valerie (Cathy Rosier), the pianist of the club and main witness of the crime, provide the necessary evidence of his innocence supporting his alibi. Free, he is betrayed and chased by the gangsters sent by the one that hired him and also by the police, not convinced of his innocence. Jef seeks out who has hired him to revenge.\"Le Samourai\" is a great French film noir with a surprising end. The plot is developed in slow pace, but with an outstanding performance of Alain Delon in the role of a cold blood killer of few words. This movie presents one of the most perfect alibis that I have seen in the cinema.My interpretation for the conclusion is the following: \"Le Samourai\" begins with a reference to the \"Bushido Code\", which is the Samurai Code, and the title is \"The Samurai\".Jef Costello, performed by Alain Delon, is the samurai, who kills his master after his betrayal, and has been discovered by the police. Therefore, he is a modern samurai in disgrace.In accordance with the Bushido Code, he must commit Harakiri, or Seppuku. Then he says farewell to Jane and goes to the night-club without any alibi (his \"modus-operandi\") or disguise, and he pretends that he will accomplish with his contract killing the piano player, to die with honor. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Samurai\" (\"The Samurai\")Note: On 02 June 2013, I saw this movie again.",

         "Jean-Pierre Melville took the idea of the lone gunman (perhaps more akin to the western genre than the crime genre), and created a film with star Alain Delon as a ultra-calm, smooth-operating contract killer Jeff Costello in Paris, who may be at least a little insane. The result is a blend of stylistic and thematic excellence, a suspense film where sometimes that aspect has to take a backseat to the psychological drama of the killer, and the side-story of the police procedural (headed by 'Superintendant' played by Francois Perier). The film carries very little dialog with a couple of exceptions, which gives Melville a chance to perfect his storytelling technique. Deleon, as well, was a very fit choice for the role of Costello. It's actually fascinating that Melville made this character, mostly a night owl with a look that's usually cold and hard boiled like some neo-hood from the 30's, the protagonist. There's also the look of the film, provided in part by Henri Decae, who would later lens Melville's epic Le Cercle Rouge. In the opening shot, were given the feeling of distortion on Costello's uniquely blank one-room apartment. Is this to bring us inside of Costello's frayed consciousness, or is it just one of those style moves done by directors in the 60's? I might go for the psychological part, but what I noticed about Le Samourai, adding to the appeal of it, was the theme of Costello's mind-set is put forth subtlety. This is a pro put into tight circumstances (getting heat from his employers as well as the police), so who is there for him to go to? Just an on & off again girlfriend (Nathalie Delon), a little bird in his apartment, and a witness to one of his contracts (the late Cathy Rosier, in a performance of some note despite the one-sidedness of her part). When the action comes, it's not as bloody as in the films it later inspired (most obvious of which are John Woo's The Killer and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog), yet that too just adds on to the emotions provoked by the settings and the mis-en-scene.So, would I recommend Le Samourai to fans of crime films? Well, it may not to those who sole obsession are the crime films that pack all the high octane juice and gore, such as in a John Woo or Hong-Kong action film, or to the Tarantino fans that may not appreciate the patience Melville has (the deliberate pace and silences) as opposed to laughs and ultra-violence. I'd guess that Le Samourai is most successful, and why it is one of the best films I will ever see, because it is heavy on the nuance and detail, doesn't skimp on keeping the genre characters believable, and leaves the gun-play as true surprises even on repeat viewings (however, this is the kind of film to be watched maybe once every year or once ever few years, so that it keeps fresh when seen again). Aside from delivering the goods in terms of the story and as a drama, for the audience it seeks out it's highly absorbing and an example of subtlety in cinematic grammar. It's not a crime or police movie for the mainstream (and I'm sure some will seek this out from the under-ground buzz, start watching and say, \"oh man, this stuff's in subtitles? I can't bear to watch\"). Really, it's appeal will hold more to fans of the french new-wave, which Melville set off with Bob le Flambeur, film-geeks, and for those looking for a dosage of atmosphere and cool bravura directors can't seem to latch onto in recent times. For me, it is one of the truly sublime time-capsule of what the gangster/noir genre/mood can produce.",

It then turns out that the house is populated by vampires (not that you wouldn't have guessed that from the title of the film). It doesn't get any better after that either.But the film does have a certain charm. The obligatory (for a 1967 horror film that is) sex and drugs scene at the beginning of the film is good fun (love that music!). The lead female vampire is very attractive and as such is destined to be seen naked at some point in the film. The surreal use of a seagull filmed through a red filter as a cheap alternative to a bat also adds to the charm of the film.Overall, it's a recommended film if you're a fan of vampire films and haven't yet seen the genre done Argentinian-style.",

         "In the early 70's, when I was in my early teens, television was an experimental place, especially on Sundays.  All sorts of interesting shows came over the color television in my family's living room, and the black-and-white one in my bed- room.  WTVC's \"Sunday Cinema\" showed some of the highest mo- ments at the apex of TV weirdness: Sunday afternoon.  One day I tuned in, and a film called \"Catch As Catch Can\" was on. It was an Italian film, dubbed in English.  My grandmother and I were in the living room watching, and I noticed it was some- thing I'd never seen before: a sex comedy!  No nudity, mind you (except for a centerfold one of the characters was ogling), but plenty of scantily-clad, well-endowed maidens.  And plenty of opportunities taken by the director to make sure the women were photographed from some point above their heads, putting their ample cleavage on display.  Up to this point, I'd only seen the likes in Life magazine spreads on Raquel Welch, and the Mark Eden Bust Enhancer ads in Redbook.  Grandmother was under- standably concerned about the quality of viewing, so she changed the channel to something else after we viewed a swim- ming pool scene in which a woman almost drowns and is resus- citated by the hero, poised above her ample bosom.  I went to my room, presumably to read.  I turned the movie back on in there.  There were other scenes I've forgotten, but one bit of titillation sticks in my mind: the hero and some busty woman rolling round and round in a giant soup can that's floating down some river.  I had a breast fixation for years after seeing the film.  I was in absolute heaven.  Story? Why worry about that?  I am decidedly more sexually mature--and definitely more politically correct--now that I am 42, but I am still very glad WTVC, for whatever reason, put that film on that day.",

Crime doesn't come more laid back and sophisticated than this. The hat, the coat, the Cirtoen DS, the lack of dialogue, the swinging doors in the police interrogation scene, the organ music in the night club... Damn!!!!!!One of THE best movies of all time. Ever.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>To see how beautiful, moving, exciting and astonishing Melville's 'Le Samourai' is, to recognise it as one of the greatest films ever made, arguably the most perfect, it is necessary to forget everything you've been told about it.  If you've been told nothing, than you are very lucky; the first time I saw I knew nothing either, and it was a revelation - I came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes - cinema can do THAT?!  I absorbed every Melville film I could find (they are VERY hard to get), and read every article or book about him.  My love grew to uncontrollable passion.  But a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work, and this sublime miracle especially.The most obvious is the director's obsession with American cinema.  That his films are mere tributes to American cinema, or stern deconstructions of them.  It is true that Jef Costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby, but so do at least 400 men in Paris.  And it is true that Melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster, but, most importantly, of masculinity and its power.  Elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here, the idea that Jef begins the film 'whole', looking at the mirror; during the course of the narrative he loses this self-sufficient image, cracking up as it fragments, split by mirrors, trapped behind bars (although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this).Others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies.  Some see Jef as an example of existentialist man, a man who does not exist except through his acts - the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking, staring, preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death; as existentialism suggests, friends, social purpose etc. fall away, and one is left alone with one's fate.  Or as an expression of fatalistic Orientalist ethics (the film IS called 'Le Samourai') concerning solitude and the inevitability of death.  Melville himself offered two possible interpretations - as a study in schizophrenia, and as an allegory of Man (Jef) pursued by Destiny (the Inspector) into the arms of Death (Valerie, the pianist).All of these, of course, are valid interpretations.  I am more sympathetic to those who see 'Samourai' as a dream, a study in solitude, or a portrait of mental breakdown.  The film's action takes place largely at night; there is a frequently oneiric tone to Melville's style, the endless walking, the silence, the deliberate  paring down of the mise-en-scene to near-monochrome.  Jef's impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist, walking mechanically down countless corridors.  As in a dream, whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way.  We keep returning to the same few locales.  The film opens with Jef lying smoking in bed, in the dark; one powerful scene is Jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm - has he had a nightmare, or is it the sound of a passing truck?'Samourai' is also much more moving as a story of solitude than Antonioni's entire oeuvre put together.  The only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is Jef's loneliness, living with his only friend, a caged bullfinch (usually a symbol of female entrapment) in a dismally run-down, sparse grey bedsit, prey to any intruders.  Although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police, he is safer on the margins, in anonymous streets, abandoned railway yards, disused buildings. Or at least he was before all the trouble started.  He is defined against the grim, geometric anonymity of modern life, his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in, the elevator shafts that imprison him.  He is the image of man in a surveillance society, an innocent man (until proven guilty) having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat (many people see Melville's films as sublimated allegories of France under the Occupation). \n",
       "His only contact with people is in the preparation of death; his is a sterile, self-negating existence, ascetic as a monk (his uniform as ritual vestments).  That Jef is a tragically lonely man is undoubted.  There are two heartbreaking moments in this cool, austere film, when emotion breaks Alain Delon's astonishing performance, the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in 'La Jetee': when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist; his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught, helpless, a child looking for a mother to reassure him (this is the key to the film, I believe, Jef the lonely wanderer searching for home); the second, after the celebrated Metro chase, in the stolen car, his face, for a moment, betraying hear-beating terror. At these moments, allegories and theories simply break down.Jef's mental breakdown is, of course, linked to all this.  Over the credits, Jef smokes alone in his bedroom, barely visible - the two bright windows look like eyes, as in Beckett's 'End Game', a figure for the mind, a mind at the end of its tether as seen by Melville's horizontal use of Hitchcock's famous 'Vertigo' shot, contracting and constricting the room to breaking point, revealing the instability of this 'safe' haven, and Jef's image of himself.  Mental deterioration is usually a subject of horror movies - the score features frequent bursts of chilling organ; when Jef goes to collect his car and gun for the contract, his accomplice, lit by a lamp, looks like a terrifying spirit.  Jef is a trapped character, in his room, identity, plot; by the police and the gangsters; by geography, shadows, corridors; by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point - he is in hell; the only way out is self extinction.It is important not to see Melville as  child of Sartre, which limits him, but of Nabokov, whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work - it is vitally important not to take him at face value.  Jef's shooting of Rey - impossible, magical - is pure Nabokov.  I could go on - the Benjaminian idea of the flaneur and Paris; the extraordinary, near-futuristic sets; the comedy (e.g. see who Jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description); its remarkable analysis of the gaze; the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics; the running motif of the theatre, performing, acting (in both senses) - Jef's costume; the line-up in a theatre-like space; the closing 'show is over' drum-roll.  Everything about this film, as John Woo noted, is perfect, but there is one sequence, breaking with Melville's calm, distant style throughout, that I would list on my ten best ever - as Jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun - firstly he faces the audience; we could be no closer.  Then, just as the struggle begins, Melville cuts away, his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills, following Jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailant's car.  It is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known.  I've just watched it twice in two days; I really must watch it again.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>A rare film where Alain Delon played together with his wife, Nathalie. The plot is about a gangster persecuted unsuccessfully by the police. Jeff Costello (Delon) was quite clever in all circumstances, he discovered that in addition to the police other gangsters were behind to kill him. His only mistake was to assume that the pianist of the cabaret (a beautiful Malgache) woman, Caty Rosier, with whom he really felt in love, was the person who provided information to all those running against him. Delon played modestly, he spoke very little in the film with brief dialogues. camera and photography, always very commercial, were in front of Delon showing the beauty of the actor.</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>First let me say that I think LE SAMOURAI is a good film. I liked it enough the first time I saw it many years ago that when I saw it recently on the shelf in my local video store, I wanted to see it again. The film has a lot of style, good use of sound and music and the presence of Alain Delon. After seeing this film for a second time recently, just as another commentator in the forum noticed, I was impressed how this film must have been very influential on American film makers in the seventies. Many thrillers of the seventies feature a loner hero much like Jef Costello.\n",
       "However, is this a great film? I don't think so. Roger Ebert and many high brow critics (you know, the ones who like to use words like \"Kafkaesque\", \"existential\" and \"archetypal\") consider this to be one of  the most perfect films ever made. But the film is far from perfect. The film at times slows down a lot. There is (mentioned previously by another commentator in this forum) the overly long and pointless scene where the cops bug Costello's apartment. Then there is an overly long scene of Costello tending to a gun shot wound. It always annoys me when I see critics (American ones) heap praises on European made films and then totally ignore or dismiss similar American films that are just as good or better than their European counterparts. Perhaps its just Paris envy.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The movie's title and opening epigraph refer to samurai, but tone and content owe more to existentialist posturing and the anti-heroes of stylized detective fiction.The title character of \"Le samourai\" is Jef Costello, a brooding loner and chick magnet, by profession a hired killer.  The movie begins with him setting about a new job with a seemingly unperturbable quiet competence, and an array of neat tricks to make himself unlinkable to the crime.  SLIGHT SPOILER: The putz then commits the murder undisguised, in earshot and almost in sight of a club full of people. Through sheer dumb luck, most witnesses are unreliable, and a pianist who can identify Costello feigns ignorance because she has fallen for him.  Costello is oblivious enough to his own bungling for his coolness to remain intact.  Ditto the movie.  There is more plot, but it's mood that matters, so who cares.Japan eliminated stipends of and formally abolished the samurai after they proved impotent against Perry's black ships and other small Western forces, and replaced them with what was to become a competent modern army.  Although samurai may still enjoy a hokey stylishness, movies, even thrillers, that wish to be serious rather than silly might be well advised to follow that example.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>In Paris, Jef Costello (Alain Delon) is a lonely hit man that works under contract. He is hired to kill the owner of a club and becomes the prime suspect of the murder. However, his perfect alibi drops the accusation against him. His girlfriend Jane (Nathalie Delon), her client and citizen above any suspicion Wiener (Michel Boisrond) and Valerie (Cathy Rosier), the pianist of the club and main witness of the crime, provide the necessary evidence of his innocence supporting his alibi. Free, he is betrayed and chased by the gangsters sent by the one that hired him and also by the police, not convinced of his innocence. Jef seeks out who has hired him to revenge.\"Le Samourai\" is a great French film noir with a surprising end. The plot is developed in slow pace, but with an outstanding performance of Alain Delon in the role of a cold blood killer of few words. This movie presents one of the most perfect alibis that I have seen in the cinema.My interpretation for the conclusion is the following: \"Le Samourai\" begins with a reference to the \"Bushido Code\", which is the Samurai Code, and the title is \"The Samurai\".Jef Costello, performed by Alain Delon, is the samurai, who kills his master after his betrayal, and has been discovered by the police. Therefore, he is a modern samurai in disgrace.In accordance with the Bushido Code, he must commit Harakiri, or Seppuku. Then he says farewell to Jane and goes to the night-club without any alibi (his \"modus-operandi\") or disguise, and he pretends that he will accomplish with his contract killing the piano player, to die with honor. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Samurai\" (\"The Samurai\")Note: On 02 June 2013, I saw this movie again.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Jean-Pierre Melville took the idea of the lone gunman (perhaps more akin to the western genre than the crime genre), and created a film with star Alain Delon as a ultra-calm, smooth-operating contract killer Jeff Costello in Paris, who may be at least a little insane. The result is a blend of stylistic and thematic excellence, a suspense film where sometimes that aspect has to take a backseat to the psychological drama of the killer, and the side-story of the police procedural (headed by 'Superintendant' played by Francois Perier). The film carries very little dialog with a couple of exceptions, which gives Melville a chance to perfect his storytelling technique. Deleon, as well, was a very fit choice for the role of Costello. It's actually fascinating that Melville made this character, mostly a night owl with a look that's usually cold and hard boiled like some neo-hood from the 30's, the protagonist. There's also the look of the film, provided in part by Henri Decae, who would later lens Melville's epic Le Cercle Rouge. In the opening shot, were given the feeling of distortion on Costello's uniquely blank one-room apartment. Is this to bring us inside of Costello's frayed consciousness, or is it just one of those style moves done by directors in the 60's? I might go for the psychological part, but what I noticed about Le Samourai, adding to the appeal of it, was the theme of Costello's mind-set is put forth subtlety. This is a pro put into tight circumstances (getting heat from his employers as well as the police), so who is there for him to go to? Just an on & off again girlfriend (Nathalie Delon), a little bird in his apartment, and a witness to one of his contracts (the late Cathy Rosier, in a performance of some note despite the one-sidedness of her part). When the action comes, it's not as bloody as in the films it later inspired (most obvious of which are John Woo's The Killer and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog), yet that too just adds on to the emotions provoked by the settings and the mis-en-scene.So, would I recommend Le Samourai to fans of crime films? Well, it may not to those who sole obsession are the crime films that pack all the high octane juice and gore, such as in a John Woo or Hong-Kong action film, or to the Tarantino fans that may not appreciate the patience Melville has (the deliberate pace and silences) as opposed to laughs and ultra-violence. I'd guess that Le Samourai is most successful, and why it is one of the best films I will ever see, because it is heavy on the nuance and detail, doesn't skimp on keeping the genre characters believable, and leaves the gun-play as true surprises even on repeat viewings (however, this is the kind of film to be watched maybe once every year or once ever few years, so that it keeps fresh when seen again). Aside from delivering the goods in terms of the story and as a drama, for the audience it seeks out it's highly absorbing and an example of subtlety in cinematic grammar. It's not a crime or police movie for the mainstream (and I'm sure some will seek this out from the under-ground buzz, start watching and say, \"oh man, this stuff's in subtitles? I can't bear to watch\"). Really, it's appeal will hold more to fans of the french new-wave, which Melville set off with Bob le Flambeur, film-geeks, and for those looking for a dosage of atmosphere and cool bravura directors can't seem to latch onto in recent times. For me, it is one of the truly sublime time-capsule of what the gangster/noir genre/mood can produce.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The worst aspect of this film is most definitely the tired script. For starters, the basic plot involves a group of young people running out of petrol and having to spend the night in a creepy house (not very original). It then turns out that the house is populated by vampires (not that you wouldn't have guessed that from the title of the film). It doesn't get any better after that either.But the film does have a certain charm. The obligatory (for a 1967 horror film that is) sex and drugs scene at the beginning of the film is good fun (love that music!). The lead female vampire is very attractive and as such is destined to be seen naked at some point in the film. The surreal use of a seagull filmed through a red filter as a cheap alternative to a bat also adds to the charm of the film.Overall, it's a recommended film if you're a fan of vampire films and haven't yet seen the genre done Argentinian-style.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>ZzzzzzzzzzzHow many ways can you write off yet another foreign vampire film whose main concern seems to be how many girls in gowns, fangs and breasts it can offer during its running time? Hey, this isn't a bad thing in itself -- but nothing else of any substance is happening here, and this is an easily passable snoozer from Argentina that you can use to help you sleep, if need be. The only things saving this from being rated a total BOMB - aside from the aforementioned babes, that is - would be an artsy credits sequence at the beginning and a couple of well executed kill sequences to open one eyelid for in between naps. * out of ****</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>In the early 70's, when I was in my early teens, television was an experimental place, especially on Sundays.  All sorts of interesting shows came over the color television in my family's living room, and the black-and-white one in my bed- room.  WTVC's \"Sunday Cinema\" showed some of the highest mo- ments at the apex of TV weirdness: Sunday afternoon.  One day I tuned in, and a film called \"Catch As Catch Can\" was on. It was an Italian film, dubbed in English.  My grandmother and I were in the living room watching, and I noticed it was some- thing I'd never seen before: a sex comedy!  No nudity, mind you (except for a centerfold one of the characters was ogling), but plenty of scantily-clad, well-endowed maidens.  And plenty of opportunities taken by the director to make sure the women were photographed from some point above their heads, putting their ample cleavage on display.  Up to this point, I'd only seen the likes in Life magazine spreads on Raquel Welch, and the Mark Eden Bust Enhancer ads in Redbook.  Grandmother was under- standably concerned about the quality of viewing, so she changed the channel to something else after we viewed a swim- ming pool scene in which a woman almost drowns and is resus- citated by the hero, poised above her ample bosom.  I went to my room, presumably to read.  I turned the movie back on in there.  There were other scenes I've forgotten, but one bit of titillation sticks in my mind: the hero and some busty woman rolling round and round in a giant soup can that's floating down some river.  I had a breast fixation for years after seeing the film.  I was in absolute heaven.  Story? Why worry about that?  I am decidedly more sexually mature--and definitely more politically correct--now that I am 42, but I am still very glad WTVC, for whatever reason, put that film on that day.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

         "To see how beautiful, moving, exciting and astonishing Melville's 'Le Samourai' is, to recognise it as one of the greatest films ever made, arguably the most perfect, it is necessary to forget everything you've been told about it.  If you've been told nothing, than you are very lucky; the first time I saw I knew nothing either, and it was a revelation - I came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes - cinema can do THAT?!  I absorbed every Melville film I could find (they are VERY hard to get), and read every article or book about him.  My love grew to uncontrollable passion.  But a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work, and this sublime miracle especially.The most obvious is the director's obsession with American cinema.  That his films are mere tributes to American cinema, or stern deconstructions of them.  It is true that Jef Costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby, but so do at least 400 men in Paris.  And it is true that Melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster, but, most importantly, of masculinity and its power.  Elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here, the idea that Jef begins the film 'whole', looking at the mirror; during the course of the narrative he loses this self-sufficient image, cracking up as it fragments, split by mirrors, trapped behind bars (although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this).Others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies.  Some see Jef as an example of existentialist man, a man who does not exist except through his acts - the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking, staring, preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death; as existentialism suggests, friends, social purpose etc. fall away, and one is left alone with one's fate.  Or as an expression of fatalistic Orientalist ethics (the film IS called 'Le Samourai') concerning solitude and the inevitability of death.  Melville himself offered two possible interpretations - as a study in schizophrenia, and as an allegory of Man (Jef) pursued by Destiny (the Inspector) into the arms of Death (Valerie, the pianist).All of these, of course, are valid interpretations.  I am more sympathetic to those who see 'Samourai' as a dream, a study in solitude, or a portrait of mental breakdown.  The film's action takes place largely at night; there is a frequently oneiric tone to Melville's style, the endless walking, the silence, the deliberate  paring down of the mise-en-scene to near-monochrome.  Jef's impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist, walking mechanically down countless corridors.  As in a dream, whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way.  We keep returning to the same few locales.  The film opens with Jef lying smoking in bed, in the dark; one powerful scene is Jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm - has he had a nightmare, or is it the sound of a passing truck?'Samourai' is also much more moving as a story of solitude than Antonioni's entire oeuvre put together.  The only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is Jef's loneliness, living with his only friend, a caged bullfinch (usually a symbol of female entrapment) in a dismally run-down, sparse grey bedsit, prey to any intruders.  Although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police, he is safer on the margins, in anonymous streets, abandoned railway yards, disused buildings. Or at least he was before all the trouble started.  He is defined against the grim, geometric anonymity of modern life, his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in, the elevator shafts that imprison him.  He is the image of man in a surveillance society, an innocent man (until proven guilty) having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat (many people see Melville's films as sublimated allegories of France under the Occupation). \nHis only contact with people is in the preparation of death; his is a sterile, self-negating existence, ascetic as a monk (his uniform as ritual vestments).  That Jef is a tragically lonely man is undoubted.  There are two heartbreaking moments in this cool, austere film, when emotion breaks Alain Delon's astonishing performance, the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in 'La Jetee': when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist; his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught, helpless, a child looking for a mother to reassure him (this is the key to the film, I believe, Jef the lonely wanderer searching for home); the second, after the celebrated Metro chase, in the stolen car, his face, for a moment, betraying hear-beating terror.

         "In the early 70's, when I was in my early teens, television was an experimental place, especially on Sundays.  All sorts of interesting shows came over the color television in my family's living room, and the black-and-white one in my bed- room.  WTVC's \"Sunday Cinema\" showed some of the highest mo- ments at the apex of TV weirdness: Sunday afternoon.  One day I tuned in, and a film called \"Catch As Catch Can\" was on. It was an Italian film, dubbed in English.  My grandmother and I were in the living room watching, and I noticed it was some- thing I'd never seen before: a sex comedy!  No nudity, mind you (except for a centerfold one of the characters was ogling), but plenty of scantily-clad, well-endowed maidens.  And plenty of opportunities taken by the director to make sure the women were photographed from some point above their heads, putting their ample cleavage on display.  Up to this point, I'd only seen the likes in Life magazine spreads on Raquel Welch, and the Mark Eden Bust Enhancer ads in Redbook.  Grandmother was under- standably concerned about the quality of viewing, so she changed the channel to something else after we viewed a swim- ming pool scene in which a woman almost drowns and is resus- citated by the hero, poised above her ample bosom.  I went to my room, presumably to read.  I turned the movie back on in there.  There were other scenes I've forgotten, but one bit of titillation sticks in my mind: the hero and some busty woman rolling round and round in a giant soup can that's floating down some river.  I had a breast fixation for years after seeing the film.  I was in absolute heaven.  Story? Why worry about that?  I am decidedly more sexually mature--and definitely more politically correct--now that I am 42, but I am still very glad WTVC, for whatever reason, put that film on that day."

Crime doesn't come more laid back and sophisticated than this. The hat, the coat, the Cirtoen DS, the lack of dialogue, the swinging doors in the police interrogation scene, the organ music in the night club... Damn!!!!!!One of THE best movies of all time. Ever.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>10.0</td><td>To see how beautiful, moving, exciting and astonishing Melville's 'Le Samourai' is, to recognise it as one of the greatest films ever made, arguably the most perfect, it is necessary to forget everything you've been told about it.  If you've been told nothing, than you are very lucky; the first time I saw I knew nothing either, and it was a revelation - I came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes - cinema can do THAT?!  I absorbed every Melville film I could find (they are VERY hard to get), and read every article or book about him.  My love grew to uncontrollable passion.  But a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work, and this sublime miracle especially.The most obvious is the director's obsession with American cinema.  That his films are mere tributes to American cinema, or stern deconstructions of them.  It is true that Jef Costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby, but so do at least 400 men in Paris.  And it is true that Melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster, but, most importantly, of masculinity and its power.  Elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here, the idea that Jef begins the film 'whole', looking at the mirror; during the course of the narrative he loses this self-sufficient image, cracking up as it fragments, split by mirrors, trapped behind bars (although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this).Others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies.  Some see Jef as an example of existentialist man, a man who does not exist except through his acts - the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking, staring, preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death; as existentialism suggests, friends, social purpose etc. fall away, and one is left alone with one's fate.  Or as an expression of fatalistic Orientalist ethics (the film IS called 'Le Samourai') concerning solitude and the inevitability of death.  Melville himself offered two possible interpretations - as a study in schizophrenia, and as an allegory of Man (Jef) pursued by Destiny (the Inspector) into the arms of Death (Valerie, the pianist).All of these, of course, are valid interpretations.  I am more sympathetic to those who see 'Samourai' as a dream, a study in solitude, or a portrait of mental breakdown.  The film's action takes place largely at night; there is a frequently oneiric tone to Melville's style, the endless walking, the silence, the deliberate  paring down of the mise-en-scene to near-monochrome.  Jef's impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist, walking mechanically down countless corridors.  As in a dream, whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way.  We keep returning to the same few locales.  The film opens with Jef lying smoking in bed, in the dark; one powerful scene is Jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm - has he had a nightmare, or is it the sound of a passing truck?'Samourai' is also much more moving as a story of solitude than Antonioni's entire oeuvre put together.  The only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is Jef's loneliness, living with his only friend, a caged bullfinch (usually a symbol of female entrapment) in a dismally run-down, sparse grey bedsit, prey to any intruders.  Although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police, he is safer on the margins, in anonymous streets, abandoned railway yards, disused buildings. Or at least he was before all the trouble started.  He is defined against the grim, geometric anonymity of modern life, his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in, the elevator shafts that imprison him.  He is the image of man in a surveillance society, an innocent man (until proven guilty) having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat (many people see Melville's films as sublimated allegories of France under the Occupation). \n",
       "His only contact with people is in the preparation of death; his is a sterile, self-negating existence, ascetic as a monk (his uniform as ritual vestments).  That Jef is a tragically lonely man is undoubted.  There are two heartbreaking moments in this cool, austere film, when emotion breaks Alain Delon's astonishing performance, the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in 'La Jetee': when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist; his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught, helpless, a child looking for a mother to reassure him (this is the key to the film, I believe, Jef the lonely wanderer searching for home); the second, after the celebrated Metro chase, in the stolen car, his face, for a moment, betraying hear-beating terror. At these moments, allegories and theories simply break down.Jef's mental breakdown is, of course, linked to all this.  Over the credits, Jef smokes alone in his bedroom, barely visible - the two bright windows look like eyes, as in Beckett's 'End Game', a figure for the mind, a mind at the end of its tether as seen by Melville's horizontal use of Hitchcock's famous 'Vertigo' shot, contracting and constricting the room to breaking point, revealing the instability of this 'safe' haven, and Jef's image of himself.  Mental deterioration is usually a subject of horror movies - the score features frequent bursts of chilling organ; when Jef goes to collect his car and gun for the contract, his accomplice, lit by a lamp, looks like a terrifying spirit.  Jef is a trapped character, in his room, identity, plot; by the police and the gangsters; by geography, shadows, corridors; by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point - he is in hell; the only way out is self extinction.It is important not to see Melville as  child of Sartre, which limits him, but of Nabokov, whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work - it is vitally important not to take him at face value.  Jef's shooting of Rey - impossible, magical - is pure Nabokov.  I could go on - the Benjaminian idea of the flaneur and Paris; the extraordinary, near-futuristic sets; the comedy (e.g. see who Jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description); its remarkable analysis of the gaze; the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics; the running motif of the theatre, performing, acting (in both senses) - Jef's costume; the line-up in a theatre-like space; the closing 'show is over' drum-roll.  Everything about this film, as John Woo noted, is perfect, but there is one sequence, breaking with Melville's calm, distant style throughout, that I would list on my ten best ever - as Jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun - firstly he faces the audience; we could be no closer.  Then, just as the struggle begins, Melville cuts away, his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills, following Jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailant's car.  It is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known.  I've just watched it twice in two days; I really must watch it again.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>7.0</td><td>A rare film where Alain Delon played together with his wife, Nathalie. The plot is about a gangster persecuted unsuccessfully by the police. Jeff Costello (Delon) was quite clever in all circumstances, he discovered that in addition to the police other gangsters were behind to kill him. His only mistake was to assume that the pianist of the cabaret (a beautiful Malgache) woman, Caty Rosier, with whom he really felt in love, was the person who provided information to all those running against him. Delon played modestly, he spoke very little in the film with brief dialogues. camera and photography, always very commercial, were in front of Delon showing the beauty of the actor.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>5.0</td><td>The movie's title and opening epigraph refer to samurai, but tone and content owe more to existentialist posturing and the anti-heroes of stylized detective fiction.The title character of \"Le samourai\" is Jef Costello, a brooding loner and chick magnet, by profession a hired killer.  The movie begins with him setting about a new job with a seemingly unperturbable quiet competence, and an array of neat tricks to make himself unlinkable to the crime.  SLIGHT SPOILER: The putz then commits the murder undisguised, in earshot and almost in sight of a club full of people. Through sheer dumb luck, most witnesses are unreliable, and a pianist who can identify Costello feigns ignorance because she has fallen for him.  Costello is oblivious enough to his own bungling for his coolness to remain intact.  Ditto the movie.  There is more plot, but it's mood that matters, so who cares.Japan eliminated stipends of and formally abolished the samurai after they proved impotent against Perry's black ships and other small Western forces, and replaced them with what was to become a competent modern army.  Although samurai may still enjoy a hokey stylishness, movies, even thrillers, that wish to be serious rather than silly might be well advised to follow that example.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>8.0</td><td>In Paris, Jef Costello (Alain Delon) is a lonely hit man that works under contract. He is hired to kill the owner of a club and becomes the prime suspect of the murder. However, his perfect alibi drops the accusation against him. His girlfriend Jane (Nathalie Delon), her client and citizen above any suspicion Wiener (Michel Boisrond) and Valerie (Cathy Rosier), the pianist of the club and main witness of the crime, provide the necessary evidence of his innocence supporting his alibi. Free, he is betrayed and chased by the gangsters sent by the one that hired him and also by the police, not convinced of his innocence. Jef seeks out who has hired him to revenge.\"Le Samourai\" is a great French film noir with a surprising end. The plot is developed in slow pace, but with an outstanding performance of Alain Delon in the role of a cold blood killer of few words. This movie presents one of the most perfect alibis that I have seen in the cinema.My interpretation for the conclusion is the following: \"Le Samourai\" begins with a reference to the \"Bushido Code\", which is the Samurai Code, and the title is \"The Samurai\".Jef Costello, performed by Alain Delon, is the samurai, who kills his master after his betrayal, and has been discovered by the police. Therefore, he is a modern samurai in disgrace.In accordance with the Bushido Code, he must commit Harakiri, or Seppuku. Then he says farewell to Jane and goes to the night-club without any alibi (his \"modus-operandi\") or disguise, and he pretends that he will accomplish with his contract killing the piano player, to die with honor. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Samurai\" (\"The Samurai\")Note: On 02 June 2013, I saw this movie again.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>10.0</td><td>Jean-Pierre Melville took the idea of the lone gunman (perhaps more akin to the western genre than the crime genre), and created a film with star Alain Delon as a ultra-calm, smooth-operating contract killer Jeff Costello in Paris, who may be at least a little insane. The result is a blend of stylistic and thematic excellence, a suspense film where sometimes that aspect has to take a backseat to the psychological drama of the killer, and the side-story of the police procedural (headed by 'Superintendant' played by Francois Perier). The film carries very little dialog with a couple of exceptions, which gives Melville a chance to perfect his storytelling technique. Deleon, as well, was a very fit choice for the role of Costello. It's actually fascinating that Melville made this character, mostly a night owl with a look that's usually cold and hard boiled like some neo-hood from the 30's, the protagonist. There's also the look of the film, provided in part by Henri Decae, who would later lens Melville's epic Le Cercle Rouge. In the opening shot, were given the feeling of distortion on Costello's uniquely blank one-room apartment. Is this to bring us inside of Costello's frayed consciousness, or is it just one of those style moves done by directors in the 60's? I might go for the psychological part, but what I noticed about Le Samourai, adding to the appeal of it, was the theme of Costello's mind-set is put forth subtlety. This is a pro put into tight circumstances (getting heat from his employers as well as the police), so who is there for him to go to? Just an on & off again girlfriend (Nathalie Delon), a little bird in his apartment, and a witness to one of his contracts (the late Cathy Rosier, in a performance of some note despite the one-sidedness of her part). When the action comes, it's not as bloody as in the films it later inspired (most obvious of which are John Woo's The Killer and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog), yet that too just adds on to the emotions provoked by the settings and the mis-en-scene.So, would I recommend Le Samourai to fans of crime films? Well, it may not to those who sole obsession are the crime films that pack all the high octane juice and gore, such as in a John Woo or Hong-Kong action film, or to the Tarantino fans that may not appreciate the patience Melville has (the deliberate pace and silences) as opposed to laughs and ultra-violence. I'd guess that Le Samourai is most successful, and why it is one of the best films I will ever see, because it is heavy on the nuance and detail, doesn't skimp on keeping the genre characters believable, and leaves the gun-play as true surprises even on repeat viewings (however, this is the kind of film to be watched maybe once every year or once ever few years, so that it keeps fresh when seen again). Aside from delivering the goods in terms of the story and as a drama, for the audience it seeks out it's highly absorbing and an example of subtlety in cinematic grammar. It's not a crime or police movie for the mainstream (and I'm sure some will seek this out from the under-ground buzz, start watching and say, \"oh man, this stuff's in subtitles? I can't bear to watch\"). Really, it's appeal will hold more to fans of the french new-wave, which Melville set off with Bob le Flambeur, film-geeks, and for those looking for a dosage of atmosphere and cool bravura directors can't seem to latch onto in recent times. For me, it is one of the truly sublime time-capsule of what the gangster/noir genre/mood can produce.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The worst aspect of this film is most definitely the tired script. For starters, the basic plot involves a group of young people running out of petrol and having to spend the night in a creepy house (not very original). It then turns out that the house is populated by vampires (not that you wouldn't have guessed that from the title of the film). It doesn't get any better after that either.But the film does have a certain charm. The obligatory (for a 1967 horror film that is) sex and drugs scene at the beginning of the film is good fun (love that music!). The lead female vampire is very attractive and as such is destined to be seen naked at some point in the film. The surreal use of a seagull filmed through a red filter as a cheap alternative to a bat also adds to the charm of the film.Overall, it's a recommended film if you're a fan of vampire films and haven't yet seen the genre done Argentinian-style.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>ZzzzzzzzzzzHow many ways can you write off yet another foreign vampire film whose main concern seems to be how many girls in gowns, fangs and breasts it can offer during its running time? Hey, this isn't a bad thing in itself -- but nothing else of any substance is happening here, and this is an easily passable snoozer from Argentina that you can use to help you sleep, if need be. The only things saving this from being rated a total BOMB - aside from the aforementioned babes, that is - would be an artsy credits sequence at the beginning and a couple of well executed kill sequences to open one eyelid for in between naps. * out of ****</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>9.0</td><td>I think - and I can hardly remember, I saw this film two times and I was deeply impressed. Lex Barker as one of my favorit actors (caused by all the Karl May based movies) appeared this time in an completely other kind of motion picture. The film itself - very strange and what's really amazing is the fact that the plot begins without a long and boring introduction. Furthermore the strange \"effects\" make this peace of art very exciting. You can only love it... Robert</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>7.0</td><td>Recently viewed this little gem as \"The Torture Chamber of Dr. sadism\". Originally released in the US and UK as \"The Blood Demon\", while it's German title was \"Die Schlangengrube und Das Pendel\". An odd film that seemed to be a sort of German take on a mixture of Bava with one of Corman's AIP Poe efforts.Count Regula (Christopher Lee) is drawn and quartered for the death of 12 maidens, but swears his revenge. 35 years later a disparate group ends up at the Counts ruined castle. The 4 travelers are Baroness Lillian (Karin Dor of Bond fame), her maid Babette, Roger (Lex Barker, former Tarzan and a huge star in Germany) and the monk Fabian (a hilarious turn from Vladimir Medar). As it turns out, Roger and the Baroness are the descendants of the folks that originally put the Count to death and he wants revenge. The crazed servant Anatol lures them to the castle and reanimates the Count. The Poe elements then come into play as Roger faces a deadly pendulum and Lillian is faced with a pit full of snakes. Do they foil the reanimated Count or meet their doom? Check this fun film out to see for yourself!I expected this to be a really bad film, but was very surprised to find that I enjoyed it tremendously. Christopher Lee's performance is all menace, but with just a smattering of black humour to keep things moving. Lex Barker, more than a decade after playing Tarzan, looks great and is a perfect heroic figure. Karin Dor is lovely and does a fair bit of over the top shrieking, but still manages to give a convincing performance. This was a whole lot of fun! A bit of dark humour, Grimm's fairytale mixed with a Mario Bava sensibility and a little Poe thrown in for good measure makes for a superior European horror flick. Hopefully a nicer print will turn up or a DVD release, as the Magnum Entertainment video that I viewed was murky, faded and very badly edited.</td><td>2.0</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

There are two heartbreaking moments in this cool, austere film, when emotion breaks Alain Delon's astonishing performance, the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in 'La Jetee': when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist; his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught, helpless, a child looking for a mother to reassure him (this is the key to the film, I believe, Jef the lonely wanderer searching for home); the second, after the celebrated Metro chase, in the stolen car, his face, for a moment, betraying hear-beating terror. At these moments, allegories and theories simply break down.Jef's mental breakdown is, of course, linked to all this.  Over the credits, Jef smokes alone in his bedroom, barely visible - the two bright windows look like eyes, as in Beckett's 'End Game', a figure for the mind, a mind at the end of its tether as seen by Melville's horizontal use of Hitchcock's famous 'Vertigo' shot, contracting and constricting the room to breaking point, revealing the instability of this 'safe' haven, and Jef's image of himself.  Mental deterioration is usually a subject of horror movies - the score features frequent bursts of chilling organ; when Jef goes to collect his car and gun for the contract, his accomplice, lit by a lamp, looks like a terrifying spirit.  Jef is a trapped character, in his room, identity, plot; by the police and the gangsters; by geography, shadows, corridors; by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point - he is in hell; the only way out is self extinction.It is important not to see Melville as  child of Sartre, which limits him, but of Nabokov, whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work - it is vitally important not to take him at face value.  Jef's shooting of Rey - impossible, magical - is pure Nabokov.  I could go on - the Benjaminian idea of the flaneur and Paris; the extraordinary, near-futuristic sets; the comedy (e.g. see who Jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description); its remarkable analysis of the gaze; the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics; the running motif of the theatre, performing, acting (in both senses) - Jef's costume; the line-up in a theatre-like space; the closing 'show is over' drum-roll.  Everything about this film, as John Woo noted, is perfect, but there is one sequence, breaking with Melville's calm, distant style throughout, that I would list on my ten best ever - as Jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun - firstly he faces the audience; we could be no closer.  Then, just as the struggle begins, Melville cuts away, his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills, following Jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailant's car.  It is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known.  I've just watched it twice in two days; I really must watch it again.",

         "Jean-Pierre Melville took the idea of the lone gunman (perhaps more akin to the western genre than the crime genre), and created a film with star Alain Delon as a ultra-calm, smooth-operating contract killer Jeff Costello in Paris, who may be at least a little insane. The result is a blend of stylistic and thematic excellence, a suspense film where sometimes that aspect has to take a backseat to the psychological drama of the killer, and the side-story of the police procedural (headed by 'Superintendant' played by Francois Perier). The film carries very little dialog with a couple of exceptions, which gives Melville a chance to perfect his storytelling technique. Deleon, as well, was a very fit choice for the role of Costello. It's actually fascinating that Melville made this character, mostly a night owl with a look that's usually cold and hard boiled like some neo-hood from the 30's, the protagonist. There's also the look of the film, provided in part by Henri Decae, who would later lens Melville's epic Le Cercle Rouge. In the opening shot, were given the feeling of distortion on Costello's uniquely blank one-room apartment. Is this to bring us inside of Costello's frayed consciousness, or is it just one of those style moves done by directors in the 60's? I might go for the psychological part, but what I noticed about Le Samourai, adding to the appeal of it, was the theme of Costello's mind-set is put forth subtlety. This is a pro put into tight circumstances (getting heat from his employers as well as the police), so who is there for him to go to? Just an on & off again girlfriend (Nathalie Delon), a little bird in his apartment, and a witness to one of his contracts (the late Cathy Rosier, in a performance of some note despite the one-sidedness of her part). When the action comes, it's not as bloody as in the films it later inspired (most obvious of which are John Woo's The Killer and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog), yet that too just adds on to the emotions provoked by the settings and the mis-en-scene.So, would I recommend Le Samourai to fans of crime films? Well, it may not to those who sole obsession are the crime films that pack all the high octane juice and gore, such as in a John Woo or Hong-Kong action film, or to the Tarantino fans that may not appreciate the patience Melville has (the deliberate pace and silences) as opposed to laughs and ultra-violence. I'd guess that Le Samourai is most successful, and why it is one of the best films I will ever see, because it is heavy on the nuance and detail, doesn't skimp on keeping the genre characters believable, and leaves the gun-play as true surprises even on repeat viewings (however, this is the kind of film to be watched maybe once every year or once ever few years, so that it keeps fresh when seen again). Aside from delivering the goods in terms of the story and as a drama, for the audience it seeks out it's highly absorbing and an example of subtlety in cinematic grammar. It's not a crime or police movie for the mainstream (and I'm sure some will seek this out from the under-ground buzz, start watching and say, \"oh man, this stuff's in subtitles? I can't bear to watch\"). Really, it's appeal will hold more to fans of the french new-wave, which Melville set off with Bob le Flambeur, film-geeks, and for those looking for a dosage of atmosphere and cool bravura directors can't seem to latch onto in recent times. For me, it is one of the truly sublime time-capsule of what the gangster/noir genre/mood can produce.",

         "The worst aspect of this film is most definitely the tired script. For starters, the basic plot involves a group of young people running out of petrol and having to spend the night in a creepy house (not very original). It then turns out that the house is populated by vampires (not that you wouldn't have guessed that from the title of the film). It doesn't get any better after that either.But the film does have a certain charm. The obligatory (for a 1967 horror film that is) sex and drugs scene at the beginning of the film is good fun (love that music!). The lead female vampire is very attractive and as such is destined to be seen naked at some point in the film. The surreal use of a seagull filmed through a red filter as a cheap alternative to a bat also adds to the charm of the film.Overall, it's a recommended film if you're a fan of vampire films and haven't yet seen the genre done Argentinian-style.",

         "Recently viewed this little gem as \"The Torture Chamber of Dr. sadism\". Originally released in the US and UK as \"The Blood Demon\", while it's German title was \"Die Schlangengrube und Das Pendel\". An odd film that seemed to be a sort of German take on a mixture of Bava with one of Corman's AIP Poe efforts.Count Regula (Christopher Lee) is drawn and quartered for the death of 12 maidens, but swears his revenge. 35 years later a disparate group ends up at the Counts ruined castle. The 4 travelers are Baroness Lillian (Karin Dor of Bond fame), her maid Babette, Roger (Lex Barker, former Tarzan and a huge star in Germany) and the monk Fabian (a hilarious turn from Vladimir Medar). As it turns out, Roger and the Baroness are the descendants of the folks that originally put the Count to death and he wants revenge. The crazed servant Anatol lures them to the castle and reanimates the Count. The Poe elements then come into play as Roger faces a deadly pendulum and Lillian is faced with a pit full of snakes. Do they foil the reanimated Count or meet their doom? Check this fun film out to see for yourself!I expected this to be a really bad film, but was very surprised to find that I enjoyed it tremendously. Christopher Lee's performance is all menace, but with just a smattering of black humour to keep things moving. Lex Barker, more than a decade after playing Tarzan, looks great and is a perfect heroic figure. Karin Dor is lovely and does a fair bit of over the top shrieking, but still manages to give a convincing performance. This was a whole lot of fun! A bit of dark humour, Grimm's fairytale mixed with a Mario Bava sensibility and a little Poe thrown in for good measure makes for a superior European horror flick. Hopefully a nicer print will turn up or a DVD release, as the Magnum Entertainment video that I viewed was murky, faded and very badly edited.",

Ever.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>10.0</td><td>To see how beautiful, moving, exciting and astonishing Melville's 'Le Samourai' is, to recognise it as one of the greatest films ever made, arguably the most perfect, it is necessary to forget everything you've been told about it.  If you've been told nothing, than you are very lucky; the first time I saw I knew nothing either, and it was a revelation - I came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes - cinema can do THAT?!  I absorbed every Melville film I could find (they are VERY hard to get), and read every article or book about him.  My love grew to uncontrollable passion.  But a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work, and this sublime miracle especially.The most obvious is the director's obsession with American cinema.  That his films are mere tributes to American cinema, or stern deconstructions of them.  It is true that Jef Costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby, but so do at least 400 men in Paris.  And it is true that Melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster, but, most importantly, of masculinity and its power.  Elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here, the idea that Jef begins the film 'whole', looking at the mirror; during the course of the narrative he loses this self-sufficient image, cracking up as it fragments, split by mirrors, trapped behind bars (although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this).Others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies.  Some see Jef as an example of existentialist man, a man who does not exist except through his acts - the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking, staring, preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death; as existentialism suggests, friends, social purpose etc. fall away, and one is left alone with one's fate.  Or as an expression of fatalistic Orientalist ethics (the film IS called 'Le Samourai') concerning solitude and the inevitability of death.  Melville himself offered two possible interpretations - as a study in schizophrenia, and as an allegory of Man (Jef) pursued by Destiny (the Inspector) into the arms of Death (Valerie, the pianist).All of these, of course, are valid interpretations.  I am more sympathetic to those who see 'Samourai' as a dream, a study in solitude, or a portrait of mental breakdown.  The film's action takes place largely at night; there is a frequently oneiric tone to Melville's style, the endless walking, the silence, the deliberate  paring down of the mise-en-scene to near-monochrome.  Jef's impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist, walking mechanically down countless corridors.  As in a dream, whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way.  We keep returning to the same few locales.  The film opens with Jef lying smoking in bed, in the dark; one powerful scene is Jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm - has he had a nightmare, or is it the sound of a passing truck?'Samourai' is also much more moving as a story of solitude than Antonioni's entire oeuvre put together.  The only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is Jef's loneliness, living with his only friend, a caged bullfinch (usually a symbol of female entrapment) in a dismally run-down, sparse grey bedsit, prey to any intruders.  Although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police, he is safer on the margins, in anonymous streets, abandoned railway yards, disused buildings. Or at least he was before all the trouble started.  He is defined against the grim, geometric anonymity of modern life, his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in, the elevator shafts that imprison him.  He is the image of man in a surveillance society, an innocent man (until proven guilty) having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat (many people see Melville's films as sublimated allegories of France under the Occupation). \n",

In the opening shot, were given the feeling of distortion on Costello's uniquely blank one-room apartment. Is this to bring us inside of Costello's frayed consciousness, or is it just one of those style moves done by directors in the 60's? I might go for the psychological part, but what I noticed about Le Samourai, adding to the appeal of it, was the theme of Costello's mind-set is put forth subtlety. This is a pro put into tight circumstances (getting heat from his employers as well as the police), so who is there for him to go to? Just an on & off again girlfriend (Nathalie Delon), a little bird in his apartment, and a witness to one of his contracts (the late Cathy Rosier, in a performance of some note despite the one-sidedness of her part). When the action comes, it's not as bloody as in the films it later inspired (most obvious of which are John Woo's The Killer and Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog), yet that too just adds on to the emotions provoked by the settings and the mis-en-scene.So, would I recommend Le Samourai to fans of crime films? Well, it may not to those who sole obsession are the crime films that pack all the high octane juice and gore, such as in a John Woo or Hong-Kong action film, or to the Tarantino fans that may not appreciate the patience Melville has (the deliberate pace and silences) as opposed to laughs and ultra-violence. I'd guess that Le Samourai is most successful, and why it is one of the best films I will ever see, because it is heavy on the nuance and detail, doesn't skimp on keeping the genre characters believable, and leaves the gun-play as true surprises even on repeat viewings (however, this is the kind of film to be watched maybe once every year or once ever few years, so that it keeps fresh when seen again). Aside from delivering the goods in terms of the story and as a drama, for the audience it seeks out it's highly absorbing and an example of subtlety in cinematic grammar. It's not a crime or police movie for the mainstream (and I'm sure some will seek this out from the under-ground buzz, start watching and say, \"oh man, this stuff's in subtitles? I can't bear to watch\"). Really, it's appeal will hold more to fans of the french new-wave, which Melville set off with Bob le Flambeur, film-geeks, and for those looking for a dosage of atmosphere and cool bravura directors can't seem to latch onto in recent times. For me, it is one of the truly sublime time-capsule of what the gangster/noir genre/mood can produce.</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>4.0</td><td>The worst aspect of this film is most definitely the tired script. For starters, the basic plot involves a group of young people running out of petrol and having to spend the night in a creepy house (not very original). It then turns out that the house is populated by vampires (not that you wouldn't have guessed that from the title of the film). It doesn't get any better after that either.But the film does have a certain charm. The obligatory (for a 1967 horror film that is) sex and drugs scene at the beginning of the film is good fun (love that music!). The lead female vampire is very attractive and as such is destined to be seen naked at some point in the film. The surreal use of a seagull filmed through a red filter as a cheap alternative to a bat also adds to the charm of the film.Overall, it's a recommended film if you're a fan of vampire films and haven't yet seen the genre done Argentinian-style.</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>2.0</td><td>ZzzzzzzzzzzHow many ways can you write off yet another foreign vampire film whose main concern seems to be how many girls in gowns, fangs and breasts it can offer during its running time?

Christopher Lee's performance is all menace, but with just a smattering of black humour to keep things moving. Lex Barker, more than a decade after playing Tarzan, looks great and is a perfect heroic figure. Karin Dor is lovely and does a fair bit of over the top shrieking, but still manages to give a convincing performance. This was a whole lot of fun! A bit of dark humour, Grimm's fairytale mixed with a Mario Bava sensibility and a little Poe thrown in for good measure makes for a superior European horror flick.

         "To see how beautiful, moving, exciting and astonishing Melville's 'Le Samourai' is, to recognise it as one of the greatest films ever made, arguably the most perfect, it is necessary to forget everything you've been told about it.  If you've been told nothing, than you are very lucky; the first time I saw I knew nothing either, and it was a revelation - I came out of the cinema with huge goggle eyes - cinema can do THAT?!  I absorbed every Melville film I could find (they are VERY hard to get), and read every article or book about him.  My love grew to uncontrollable passion.  But a lot cliches and received truths have grown up around his work, and this sublime miracle especially.The most obvious is the director's obsession with American cinema.  That his films are mere tributes to American cinema, or stern deconstructions of them.  It is true that Jef Costello wears the classic film noir garb of mac and derby, but so do at least 400 men in Paris.  And it is true that Melville rigorously exposes the myth of the gangster, but, most importantly, of masculinity and its power.  Elaborate theories of psychoanalysis are usually brought in here, the idea that Jef begins the film 'whole', looking at the mirror; during the course of the narrative he loses this self-sufficient image, cracking up as it fragments, split by mirrors, trapped behind bars (although the halved banknotes he consciously plays with at the beginning might qualify this).Others comment on the film less as a gangster film than a dramatisation of particular philosophies.  Some see Jef as an example of existentialist man, a man who does not exist except through his acts - the film patiently records endless scenes of Jef walking, staring, preparing for his jobs etc. His final ritual is a preparation for his death; as existentialism suggests, friends, social purpose etc. fall away, and one is left alone with one's fate.  Or as an expression of fatalistic Orientalist ethics (the film IS called 'Le Samourai') concerning solitude and the inevitability of death.  Melville himself offered two possible interpretations - as a study in schizophrenia, and as an allegory of Man (Jef) pursued by Destiny (the Inspector) into the arms of Death (Valerie, the pianist).All of these, of course, are valid interpretations.  I am more sympathetic to those who see 'Samourai' as a dream, a study in solitude, or a portrait of mental breakdown.  The film's action takes place largely at night; there is a frequently oneiric tone to Melville's style, the endless walking, the silence, the deliberate  paring down of the mise-en-scene to near-monochrome.  Jef's impassivity is comparable to that of a somnambulist, walking mechanically down countless corridors.  As in a dream, whole sequences are repeated in exactly the same way.  We keep returning to the same few locales.  The film opens with Jef lying smoking in bed, in the dark; one powerful scene is Jef waking up after he has bandaged his wounded arm - has he had a nightmare, or is it the sound of a passing truck?'Samourai' is also much more moving as a story of solitude than Antonioni's entire oeuvre put together.  The only sure thing in this strange and enigmatic film is Jef's loneliness, living with his only friend, a caged bullfinch (usually a symbol of female entrapment) in a dismally run-down, sparse grey bedsit, prey to any intruders.  Although he is constantly forced into the centre of the city by work and the police, he is safer on the margins, in anonymous streets, abandoned railway yards, disused buildings. Or at least he was before all the trouble started.  He is defined against the grim, geometric anonymity of modern life, his milieu as soulless and constricting as the plot he moves in, the elevator shafts that imprison him.  He is the image of man in a surveillance society, an innocent man (until proven guilty) having his every move followed by a police happy to use morality as a threat (many people see Melville's films as sublimated allegories of France under the Occupation). \nHis only contact with people is in the preparation of death; his is a sterile, self-negating existence, ascetic as a monk (his uniform as ritual vestments).  That Jef is a tragically lonely man is undoubted.  There are two heartbreaking moments in this cool, austere film, when emotion breaks Alain Delon's astonishing performance, the most beautiful man in the movies letting slip just like the stills moving in 'La Jetee': when he goes back to the scene of the crime and looks at the pianist; his face for a brief second seems absolutely distraught, helpless, a child looking for a mother to reassure him (this is the key to the film, I believe, Jef the lonely wanderer searching for home); the second, after the celebrated Metro chase, in the stolen car, his face, for a moment, betraying hear-beating terror. At these moments, allegories and theories simply break down.Jef's mental breakdown is, of course, linked to all this.  Over the credits, Jef smokes alone in his bedroom, barely visible - the two bright windows look like eyes, as in Beckett's 'End Game', a figure for the mind, a mind at the end of its tether as seen by Melville's horizontal use of Hitchcock's famous 'Vertigo' shot, contracting and constricting the room to breaking point, revealing the instability of this 'safe' haven, and Jef's image of himself.  Mental deterioration is usually a subject of horror movies - the score features frequent bursts of chilling organ; when Jef goes to collect his car and gun for the contract, his accomplice, lit by a lamp, looks like a terrifying spirit.  Jef is a trapped character, in his room, identity, plot; by the police and the gangsters; by geography, shadows, corridors; by the loop of time that forces him to return again and again to the same point - he is in hell; the only way out is self extinction.It is important not to see Melville as  child of Sartre, which limits him, but of Nabokov, whose complex procedures of ludic expression find a cinematic equivalent in his work - it is vitally important not to take him at face value.  Jef's shooting of Rey - impossible, magical - is pure Nabokov.  I could go on - the Benjaminian idea of the flaneur and Paris; the extraordinary, near-futuristic sets; the comedy (e.g. see who Jef rides with in the police van answering to the same description); its remarkable analysis of the gaze; the brilliance of its action and suspense mechanics; the running motif of the theatre, performing, acting (in both senses) - Jef's costume; the line-up in a theatre-like space; the closing 'show is over' drum-roll.  Everything about this film, as John Woo noted, is perfect, but there is one sequence, breaking with Melville's calm, distant style throughout, that I would list on my ten best ever - as Jef goes to collect the cash and is instead faced with a gun - firstly he faces the audience; we could be no closer.  Then, just as the struggle begins, Melville cuts away, his camera manically panning away from the action behind bridge grills, following Jef as he runs and ineffectually chases his assailant's car.  It is a heartstopping moment in a film still too little known.  I've just watched it twice in two days; I really must watch it again.",

         "A rare film where Alain Delon played together with his wife, Nathalie. The plot is about a gangster persecuted unsuccessfully by the police. Jeff Costello (Delon) was quite clever in all circumstances, he discovered that in addition to the police other gangsters were behind to kill him. His only mistake was to assume that the pianist of the cabaret (a beautiful Malgache) woman, Caty Rosier, with whom he really felt in love, was the person who provided information to all those running against him. Delon played modestly, he spoke very little in the film with brief dialogues. camera and photography, always very commercial, were in front of Delon showing the beauty of the actor.",

         "The movie's title and opening epigraph refer to samurai, but tone and content owe more to existentialist posturing and the anti-heroes of stylized detective fiction.The title character of \"Le samourai\" is Jef Costello, a brooding loner and chick magnet, by profession a hired killer.  The movie begins with him setting about a new job with a seemingly unperturbable quiet competence, and an array of neat tricks to make himself unlinkable to the crime.  SLIGHT SPOILER: The putz then commits the murder undisguised, in earshot and almost in sight of a club full of people. Through sheer dumb luck, most witnesses are unreliable, and a pianist who can identify Costello feigns ignorance because she has fallen for him.  Costello is oblivious enough to his own bungling for his coolness to remain intact.  Ditto the movie.  There is more plot, but it's mood that matters, so who cares.Japan eliminated stipends of and formally abolished the samurai after they proved impotent against Perry's black ships and other small Western forces, and replaced them with what was to become a competent modern army.  Although samurai may still enjoy a hokey stylishness, movies, even thrillers, that wish to be serious rather than silly might be well advised to follow that example.",

         "In Paris, Jef Costello (Alain Delon) is a lonely hit man that works under contract. He is hired to kill the owner of a club and becomes the prime suspect of the murder. However, his perfect alibi drops the accusation against him. His girlfriend Jane (Nathalie Delon), her client and citizen above any suspicion Wiener (Michel Boisrond) and Valerie (Cathy Rosier), the pianist of the club and main witness of the crime, provide the necessary evidence of his innocence supporting his alibi. Free, he is betrayed and chased by the gangsters sent by the one that hired him and also by the police, not convinced of his innocence. Jef seeks out who has hired him to revenge.\"Le Samourai\" is a great French film noir with a surprising end. The plot is developed in slow pace, but with an outstanding performance of Alain Delon in the role of a cold blood killer of few words. This movie presents one of the most perfect alibis that I have seen in the cinema.My interpretation for the conclusion is the following: \"Le Samourai\" begins with a reference to the \"Bushido Code\", which is the Samurai Code, and the title is \"The Samurai\".Jef Costello, performed by Alain Delon, is the samurai, who kills his master after his betrayal, and has been discovered by the police. Therefore, he is a modern samurai in disgrace.In accordance with the Bushido Code, he must commit Harakiri, or Seppuku. Then he says farewell to Jane and goes to the night-club without any alibi (his \"modus-operandi\") or disguise, and he pretends that he will accomplish with his contract killing the piano player, to die with honor. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Samurai\" (\"The Samurai\")Note: On 02 June 2013, I saw this movie again.",

         "Jean-Pierre Melville took the idea of the lone gunman (perhaps more akin to the western genre than the crime genre), and created a film with star Alain Delon as a ultra-calm, smooth-operating contract killer Jeff Costello in Paris, who may be at least a little insane. The result is a blend of stylistic and thematic excellence, a suspense film where sometimes that aspect has to take a backseat to the psychological drama of the killer, and the side-story of the police procedural (headed by 'Superintendant' played by Francois Perier). The film carries very little dialog with a couple of exceptions, which gives Melville a chance to perfect his storytelling technique. Deleon, as well, was a very fit choice for the role of Costello. It's actually fascinating that Melville made this character, mostly a night owl with a look that's usually cold and hard boiled like some neo-hood from the 30's, the protagonist.

importantly, of, masculinity, and, its, power, elaborate, theories, of, psychoanalysis, are, usually, brought, in, here, the, idea, that, jef, begins, the, film, whole, looking, at, the, mirror,

his, wounded, arm, has, he, had, a, nightmare, or, is, it, the, sound, of, a, passing, truck, samourai, is, also, much, more, moving, as, a, story, of, solitude, than, antonioni, s, entire, oeuvre, put, together, the, only, sure, thing, in, this, strange, and, enigmatic, film, is, jef, s, loneliness, living, with, his, only, friend, a, caged, bullfinch, usually, a, symbol, of, female,
